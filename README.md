# Winter School on Physics of the Cell - Modelling phototransduction and other biochemical networks
This report is based on the hands-on session, given at the University of Trento by Prof. Daniele Dellâ€™Orco, on January 29th, 2020, in the context of the Winter School on Physics of the Cell. The objective of this write-up is on one hand to briefly synthesize the lecture on the modelling of dynamic biophysical systems, on the other hand to implement a simplified model of phototransduction via the ODEbased version of IQMtools, i.e. a MATLAB toolbox used in class for the implementation of a different biophysical system.
